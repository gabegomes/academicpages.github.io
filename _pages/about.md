# About Me
Gabe received his B.Sc. in Chemistry from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Mothè Esteves, in 2013. His research at that university was focused on theoretical studies of electrophilic aromatic nitration via single electron transfer and a final project on theoretical/experimental development of methane clathrates inhibitors. He also spent a year at the University of Lisbon, Portugal in an academic exchange researching graphene oxides, with Professor Maria José Lourenço. In Fall 2014, he joined the laboratory of Professor Igor V. Alabugin at the Florida State University as a graduate student, where he also was awarded the LASER Fellowship earlier that year and the 2016-2017 IBM Ph.D Scholarship. In 2018, Gabe has been: awarded the FSU's Graduate Student Research and Creativity Award for his work in Computational Chemistry; awarded the ACS COMP Chemical Computing Group Excellence Award for his work on the mechanism of the Gold-Catalyzed Bergman Cyclization; selected for the CAS SciFinder Future Leaders Program; selected for the ACS ORGN Graduate Research Symposium. Gabe is interested on solving problems in organic chemistry with the use of computational  tools.
